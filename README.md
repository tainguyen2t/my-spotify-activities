# My Facebook Activities

This project takes a brutally honest look at **my Facebook history** from the early cringe-posting days until now 📅.  
From *status updates nobody asked for* to *random group joins at 2AM*, it’s a data-driven therapy session for my digital past.

## Project information
- **Conducted by**: Tai Nguyen *(tainguyen0604@gmail.com)*
- **Period**: Aug 4th – Aug 10th 2025 *(Data exported from Facebook – timestamps normalized to UTC+7)*
- **Contribution breakdown:**

     |--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
     | **Self-conducted** | Data cleaning, plotting, and surviving the nostalgia wave                  | 70%   |
     | **AI-assisted**    | Untangling nested JSON hell, regex black magic, markdown styling therapy   | 20%   |

     > ***Behind the scenes**: Parsing that 12.0GB Facebook export made me question *every* life choice since 2010.*
